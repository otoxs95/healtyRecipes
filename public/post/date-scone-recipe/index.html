    <p><strong>Grandma S Famous Date Scones Recipe Australia S Best Recipes</strong>. My easy date scones are the only scones recipe you will ever need! Did double mixture so got 16 med size great date scones. I thought it was sweet and nothing like a date. An easy recipe for wholemeal date scones. Best recipe i have tried so far! These traditional light and fluffy scones are sweetened with the richness of the dates. The date scones weren&#039;t vegan so i never had one and pretty soon i totally forgot all about them. Doreen taylor&#039;s scones disappeared at ladies&#039; guild suppers and sold out she believes her mother&#039;s scones were popular because they were very moist. I adapted the classic scone recipe from the edmond&#039;s cookbook. Oh yum with anna olson. Professional baker&#039;s amazing citrus scone recipe! They only take half an hour in total to make from scratch! This date scone recipe is based on one that i saw on australia&#039;s version of masterchef quite a few years ago. These scones are light and fluffy and packed full of dates! I am sure the egg makes a difference.</p>
