But this broccoli potato cheese soup recipe doesn&#039;t sacrifice flavor in it&#039;s ingredient modifications, but instead is a healthyish version of my childhood fave. Generously season with salt and pepper. This is a chunky broccoli and potato in a thick and creamy soup broth that&#039;s made with no cream. This is not your average broccoli soup instead of merely boiling the broccoli to cook it, here, the florets are seared until deeply browned on one side while remaining bright green on the other this gives the soup a layer of caramelized flavor while also preserving the fresh green taste of the broccoli itself. Bright green broccoli florets float prettily in this hearty soup, but it&#039;s broccoli stems that do the real work. Thick, hearty and creamy, this broccoli and potato soup is fast and easy to make, and only 405 calories a serving! A satisyfing, creamy broccoli and potato soup with cheese. This creamy and cheesy potato soup with broccoli comes together quickly for an easy and quick weeknight meal that everyone will love. Broccoli and potatoes are simmered in a creamy soup creating a warm and filling meal for cold winter nights. Soaked cashews and nutritional yeast blended together with golden potatoes and homemade veggie stock give this soup that super rich creaminess without the addition of any cream or dairy at all. Pour broth into potato mixture, cover, and simmer until potatoes are softened, about 10 minutes. Cheese compliments broccoli and potatoes so well. I love to serve it with homemade rolls or bread and a salad.</p>

        <p>It&#039;s a classic potato broccoli soup with all the creamy / cheesy flavors you would expect, but it&#039;s it&#039;s actually quite similar to the pea soup recipe i made years ago, though this one has broccoli instead of peas (obviously), different herbs, and nutritional yeast + cashew cream to make it super cheesy.
