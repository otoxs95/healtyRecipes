Add the vegetable broth, just to puree the soup with either an immersion blender, or a food processor. If using the food processor, puree the soup in batches; I haven&#039;t made leek and potato soup very often at home before, but i&#039;m always drawn to it, if it&#039;s on offer for a restaurant starter, and i do occasionally. Place the leeks, potatoes, carrots, celery, and garlic in the slow cooker pot. Serve with thick wodges of bread, if desired. It&#039;s delicious and perfect for either lunch or dinner. Slow cooker leek and potato soup. Do not pour all of the soup. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
