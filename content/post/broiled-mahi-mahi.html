    <p><strong>Broiled Mahi Mahi</strong>. To add some flavor to my grilled mahi mahi fish, i use a marinade that consists of: 5 pounds skinned, deboned mahi mahi, cut into chunks, 3/4 (4.5 ounce) jar bottled minced garlic, 1/2 cup butter, diced, 1 large onion, diced, 1 1/2 lemons, juiced, 1/2 cup dry white wine, 1 1/2 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with crumbled feta, and garnish with lemon slices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and the thyme and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Fresh basil, paprika, lemon, italian parsley, mahi mahi, crushed red pepper and 4 more. Myrecipes has 70,000+ tested recipes and videos to help you be a better cook. Mahi mahi has a delicate flavor, so the wine chosen shouldn&#039;t overwhelm with its flavor. Seasoned simply with sea salt and broiled quickly in a hot oven. Light and fruity white wines pair well with this grilled mahi mahi recipe. 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 2 tbs. The keys to grilled mahi mahi is to get the grill really hot, oil the fish (not the grates) and leave it alone until the flesh of the fish sears properly, releasing it from the grill grates. Set aside and cover with plastic wrap. The monterey bay aquarium classifies it as a good choice when considering environmental impact. Medium high heat is perfect for grilling mahi mahi on the grill.
