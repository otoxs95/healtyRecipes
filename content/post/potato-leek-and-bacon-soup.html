    <p><strong>Quick Potato Leek Bacon Soup In Instant Pot Video Munchkin Time</strong>. Leek, bacon &amp; potato soup. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, then add the leeks and garlic; 5 out of 5.299 ratings. Tip in the leeks and potatoes, stir well, then cover and turn down the heat. Add watercress for potage au cresson, serve it chilled for vichyssoise — or top it with bacon. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Potato leek soup, or potage parmentier, is a french classic. Potatoes, leeks and bacon team up in a flavorful soup you&#039;ll love paired with crusty bread or a nice salad. Cover and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. It&#039;s one of the first dishes i learned to make in culinary school, right after a proper omelet, because it&#039;s an essential base soup in french cuisine. Add the broth, 2 cups water, the potatoes and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper; Easy, creamy, tasty, potato, leek and bacon soup. I love it with buttered toast to dip in. Melt the butter in a large pan, then fry the bacon and onion, stirring until they start to turn golden. You can serve it with some parmesan sprinkled on top or chives.</p>
