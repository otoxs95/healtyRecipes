I believe this version is just as good or better than you could order at any. By making broccoli soup in the instant pot, you can have a flavorful comfort food without any of the guilt (and in a fraction of the time!). It is cold here in logan, ut (at least in the mornings and afternoons)! So today i&#039;m sharing a delicious soup recipe that only takes a few minutes to throw. At this point i like to take half the soup and blend until smooth and creamy and then add it back to the pot, it makes for a thicker soup. And you guys are going to love! Lock the lid into place, making sure the nozzle is in the sealing position. While most broccoli potato soups generally contain more ingredients, the base of this soup is made entirely with potatoes and broccoli. Instant pot broccoli soup is full of nutrients and flavor, making it an easy vegan soup! Use the manual mode and set when it&#039;s cool, blend the soup (minus the broccoli florets that you just reserved) in batches in your blender (or all in one go with a blender stick), until all. Add the broccoli to the pot, pop on the lid, and set instant pot to cook at high pressure for 8 minutes. Thick and creamy instant pot broccoli cheese soup is a quick and easy, naturally gluten free broccoli cheddar soup prepared in only 15 minutes! Turn off the instant pot, add the water and stir. Broccoli potato soup is a soup i&#039;ve been making for years, but i just gave it a paleo, whole30, and instant pot makeover.</p>
