This pumpkin and ginger soup is a tasty, creative way to make use of the leftover carved up pumpkin on halloween and create an aromatic pick and finely chop the herbs. I roasted the pumpkin, an apple, an onion and a few garlic cloves all in the oven. Instead, the vegetables and greek yogurt this creamy pumpkin ginger soup is healthy, warm, and comforting. This warming pumpkin ginger soup recipe is absolutely bursting with flavor, quickly prepared, healthy, creamy, vegan, and perfect comfort food for all pumpkin fans!</p>
