When i hear the words baked chicken breast, i can&#039;t say that i&#039;m terribly excited by the sound of it. They turn a simple dinner into a sensational meal. I have to tell you that i have been absolutely loving my air fryer as of late. We are huge chicken fans here, eat it at least three times per week! In this instructable, i split each half and cook them gently. Air fryer bone in chicken breasts. The skin and bones of the breast provide flavor and also act as a barrier against drying out. It always makes crispy skin, and the most moist white meat you&#039;ll ever eat! Like the boneless breast, you&#039;re familiar with, this cut is lean with a little extra flavor. It&#039;s cheaper than buying boneless/skinless, in my opinion tastier, and just as quick and easy! This recipe for the best baked bone in skin on chicken. Bake in preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
