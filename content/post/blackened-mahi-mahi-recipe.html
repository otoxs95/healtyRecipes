Keeping it light, i served this blackened mahi mahi over steamed rice, salad and lemon slices. This blackened mahi mahi is made with a traditional blackened seasoning mix of paprika, cayenne pepper, ground ginger, black pepper i have my blackened seafood seasoning blend in the recipe below. I always thought you could only make them in the oven but it&#039;s literally done in just 8 minutes on a skillet.</p>
