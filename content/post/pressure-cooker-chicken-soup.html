For this italian chicken soup, a whole chicken is cooked with a few chopped vegetables for 25 minutes. When we first got a pressure cooker, little did i know that i&#039;d be able to improve on my wife&#039;s recipe for chicken soup; The other day my friend michele as much as i love a pot of soup simmering on the stove, i love that i can make classic chicken noodle soup in just minutes in my pressure cooker. This use of the pressure cooker creates both a wonderful soup broth and perfectly cooked chicken (not that soggy stuff…) This chicken soup pressure cooker recipe is really flexible, and it&#039;s easy to customize the chicken you use to what you have on hand. Stir some cooked noodles into the soup;</p>
