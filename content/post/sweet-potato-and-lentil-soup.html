My favorite way to freeze this soup is in individual small containers that are freezer safe. While some people dread the change of seasons, i love it! For a similar but far superior recipe try the sweet potato carrot apple and red lentil soup on allrecipes. This sweet potato &amp; lentil soup is cozy, hearty, and made with only 8 healthy ingredients! Lentils, sweet potatoes, onions, and spinach are a few simple vegan ingredients are cooked with aromatic and flavorful indian spices to quickly create an utterly delicious and hearty meal. It makes for the perfect excuse. Can you freeze sweet potato + red lentil soup?</p>
